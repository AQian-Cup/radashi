- **What is this?**  
  A fork of the renowned [`radash`](https://github.com/sodiray/radash) library by Ray Epps [@sodiray](https://github.com/sodiray).

- **Why does this exist?**  
  This fork aims to be a more consistently maintained version of the library, with bug fixes and improvements. Pull requests are encouraged, but please keep them small and focused. Sweeping changes are discouraged and won't be merged.

- **Can I help you maintain this?**  
  Yes! I'll add you as a contributor to the repository. You can review pull requests and even merge them. You can help with closing issues, too. Committing directly to the main branch is a privilege you can earn, as is publishing versions to NPM. [Apply here.](https://github.com/orgs/radashi-org/discussions/4)

- **Is backwards compatibility a goal?**  
  Yes! We want the transition from `radash` to this library to be smooth. We'll make sure to avoid breaking changes. If any are made, they will be clearly documented at the bottom of this page.

- **Is there official documentation?**  
  Currently, there is no documentation beyond this page. I will get to it eventually, but for now, you can refer to the original `radash` documentation [here](https://radash-docs.vercel.app).
